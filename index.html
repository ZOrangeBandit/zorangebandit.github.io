    <h1>My funny car</h1>
    <p id="car-paragraph">My car is a 1995 Subaru Sambar Dias Classic. I recently imported my car over around a year from the Fall of 2023, to the Summer of 2024. I have done a lot of the maintainance required on it, including changing the fuel, oil, and air filters, the oil itself, the spark plugs and spark plug wires, and the cars battery. I still have to change the transmission fluid, and some repairs on a couple of the interior side panels. Due to the age of the vehicle, I am also considering adding electronic locks. Being a kei car, my car has a minute engine, with a displacement of 660cc. For refrence, the 1995 Honda Accord had a minimum engine displacement of 1800cc, and the 1997 Toyota Prius had a minimum engine displacement of 1500cc. Proprotionally to its small engine, the car has a low maximum speed of around 55 mph.
